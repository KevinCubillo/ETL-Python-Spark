# Data Analysis Project - INEC and OIJ

This project aims to perform data analysis using the datasets from Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos (INEC) and Organismo de Investigación Judicial (OIJ) in Costa Rica. The goal is to compare the number of reported crimes in different districts and their relationship with the employment statistics provided by INEC.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Apache Spark
- PostgreSQL
- Jupyter Notebook

## Database Configuration

Before running the code, make sure you have a configured and accessible PostgreSQL database. Update the connection details in the code to reflect your own database configuration.

## Running the Code

1. Make sure you have all the dependencies and requirements installed.
2. Open the `notebook.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Execute the cells in order to load the data, clean it, merge it, and perform the corresponding analysis.

## Results

The code will generate visualizations and analysis of the data, including bar charts of the number of crimes and the occupation rate in the top 10 districts with the highest crime rates, charts of the days of the week with the most crimes, charts of crime types by district, charts of the number of crimes by gender, and charts of the number of crimes by province.
